A Toolbox for Analyzing and Visualizing Team Sports Performance, with a particular focus on Football Match Data.
The toolbox includes modules for data processing, statistical analysis, match outcome prediction, and result visualization.

Current version: 0.1.0

Introduction
------------
pyTSPA was developed to support coaches, analysts, and sports scientists in extracting actionable insights from football match data. Designed with a football-centric approach, the toolbox facilitates data handling, statistical analysis, match outcome prediction using machine learning, and comprehensive data visualization.

Description
-----------
The toolbox is divided into the following modules:

- **Data Handling:** Data input/output, cleaning, and profiling (CSV, Excel).
- **Metrics:** Calculation of match and team statistics (Win Percentage, Pythagorean Expectation) and predictive models using logistic regression.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representation of match data, statistical summaries, and prediction results using bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.

Datasets
--------
The datasets used for testing and demonstration purposes are primarily sourced from public football datasets.
